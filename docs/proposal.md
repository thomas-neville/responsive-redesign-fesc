# Website Redesign Proposal for Florida Energy Systems Consortium
<http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/>

## State of the Current Site
The current website uses a busy layout for the homepage:
* cycling images in the header
* multiple navigation bars (with some overlapping links and some unique)
* more than five different fonts
* more than five different font colors
* styles change on linked pages

### Accessibility Audit
#### Google Accessibility Developer Tools Audit
Score: 59%
Some elements fail the following criteria:
- image elements do not have "alt" attributes
- not all elements have discernable names and do not describe contents well, impacting screen readers
- low contrast text makes it difficult or impossible for many users to read

#### WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
Errors (11):
- 3 missing alternative text
- 6 linked images missing alternative text
- 1 missing label
- 1 empty heading

Alerts (7):
- 1 suspicious link text
- 4 redundant links
- 1 link to PDF document
- 1 Noscript element

Features (17):
- 16 linked images with alt text
- 1 form label

HTML5 and ARIA (1):
- 1 search
