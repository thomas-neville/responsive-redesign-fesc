# Design Plan for Florida Energy Systems Consortium
<http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/>

## Research and Inspiration

### Notes on Research and Inspiration
#### Bloomberg Graphics
* Very readable layout with lots of white space and contrast with colors
* One featured article takes up 50% of the page, other modules take 1/8 and stack
* Conveys different options for available articles clearly
* Low contrast lines define articles, thicker lines at the top of the module, thinner lines in between

#### Consumer Reports Product Listing
* Very readable layout with lots of white space and high contrast colors and images
* Intuitive image navigation
* All basic information is in view on page load, no scrolling needed to see important information
* Modules in this layout do not line up in columns and some text, like title, overlap columns

#### CSS-Tricks
* Low contrast design with similar dark colors for sections
* Article is centered on page
* Gradients for some sections (low contrast, subtle changes)
* Highlighting important information with high contrast bright font colors

#### Microsoft Fluent Design
* Unique scrolling experience, viewport sized panes layered over each other
* Scroll rate of images and text is different
* Elaborate animation on page load, and nice graphics through out page
* Images and scrolling experience is emphasized more than text
* Use of shadows under scrolling panes emphasizes change of subject

#### National Geographic
* Animated infographics end with clear data
* Minimal clear text, large font, centered
* Animated colors end with soft colors
* Very simple small header, with a few main options and dropdown for more links in an intuitive location

#### What to include 
At a basic level, more detailed information on these in *Theme* section
* High contrast
* Center articles
* Subtle lines to divide information
* Pleasant scrolling experience
* Readable fonts for articles, slightly more stylized for headings (should be professional)
* Infographic if there is information available
* Transparency and gradients 

## Theme
### Fonts
Google Fonts:
* Open Sans
* Source Sans Pro

Easy to read and common fonts, not distracting from the information intended to be conveyed.

### Colors
Background: White or very light gray
Font color: Dark gray or black

*Incorporate logo colors in the web page*
Since the logo colors are not complimentary of each other, use transparency or gradients. 
* Limit the amount of the color, small lines should be used
Logo Colors (from dropper extension):
Seagreen: #00784b; rgb(0,120,75)
Brown(Red): #981c1e; rgb(152,28,30)
Darkkhaki: #ceb36c; rgb(206,179,108)
