## Research and Inspiration

### Notes on Research and Inspiration
#### Bloomberg Graphics
![alt text]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomas-neville/responsive-redesign-fesc/master/docs/bloomberg-graphics.PNG "Bloomberg Graphics")
* Very readable layout with lots of white space and contrast with colors
* One featured article takes up 50% of the page, other modules take 1/8 and stack
* Conveys different options for available articles clearly
* Low contrast lines define articles, thicker lines at the top of the module, thinner lines in between

#### Consumer Reports Product Listing
* Very readable layout with lots of white space and high contrast colors and images
* Intuitive image navigation
* All basic information is in view on page load, no scrolling needed to see important information
* Modules in this layout do not line up in columns and some text, like title, overlap columns

#### CSS-Tricks
* Low contrast design with similar dark colors for sections
* Article is centered on page
* Gradients for some sections (low contrast, subtle changes)
* Highlighting important information with high contrast bright font colors

#### Microsoft Fluent Design
* Unique scrolling experience, viewport sized panes layered over each other
* Scroll rate of images and text is different
* Elaborate animation on page load, and nice graphics through out page
* Images and scrolling experience is emphasized more than text
* Use of shadows under scrolling panes emphasizes change of subject

#### National Geographic
* Animated infographics end with clear data
* Minimal clear text, large font, centered
* Animated colors end with soft colors
* Very simple small header, with a few main options and dropdown for more links in an intuitive location

#### What to include 
At a basic level, more detailed information on these in *Theme* section
* High contrast
* Center articles
* Subtle lines to divide information
* Pleasant scrolling experience
* Readable fonts for articles, slightly more stylized for headings (should be professional)
* Infographic if there is information available
* Transparency and gradients 

## Theme
### Fonts
Google Fonts:
* Open Sans
* Source Sans Pro

Easy to read and common fonts, not distracting from the information intended to be conveyed.

### Colors
Background: White or very light gray
Font color: Dark gray or black

Incorporate logo colors in the web page
Since the logo colors are not complimentary of each other, use transparency or gradients. 
* Limit the amount of the color, small lines should be used
Logo Colors (from dropper extension):
* Seagreen: #00784b; rgb(0,120,75)
* Brown(Red): #981c1e; rgb(152,28,30)
* Darkkhaki: #ceb36c; rgb(206,179,108)
* Darkslateblue: #263995; rgb(38,57,149)
* Chocolate(orange): #f57722; rgb(245,119,34)

## Modules
### Header
The header will include:
* Logo
* Top Navigation
* Search

Options for styling:
* Sticky Navigation - larger options on page load and condense to simple menu and/or dropdown
* Hamburger menu for mobile
* Gradient bottom border (blue to green)
* Transparency on background navigation color (off logo color scheme)

### Section and Article
* Center on page
* Increase font size
* High contrast (light background, dark font)
* Box shadow
* Small subtle line (on logo color scheme) left, top, or right border
* Headings larger text (possibly a logo color)

### Images
* Overlay text on images, link to relevant pages
* Alternate sides of the screen with text/images

### Contact Profiles
* Image of staff member with contact information
* Alternate sides with images/text

### Visit Us
* Holds iframe map
* Possibly incorporate with footer, but user need for this is probably low priority

### Footer
* Scrollable list of universities/colleges with images (possible text links in columns)
* Contact us information - link to *Contact Us* page

### Aside Navigation
* Possibly incorporated with the footer
* Pop up menu from either "Suggested Search Options," "Site Map" in footer, or hover over pop up menu from a side of the screen

## General Layout Notes
* Article text and informational text should be the focus
* Font consistency, sizing, readability are the most important aspect
* Aside Menu options are overwhelming and should be hidden
* More white space with stylized lines to divide sections
* Transparency on images
