# Design Plan for Florida Energy Systems Consortium
<http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/>

## Research and Inspiration

### Notes on Research and Inspiration
#### Bloomberg Graphics
* Very readable layout with lots of white space and contrast with colors
* One featured article takes up 50% of the page, other modules take 1/8 and stack
* Conveys different options for available articles clearly
* Low contrast lines define articles, thicker lines at the top of the module, thinner lines in between

#### Consumer Reports Product Listing
* Very readable layout with lots of white space and high contrast colors and images
* Intuitive image navigation
* All basic information is in view on page load, no scrolling needed to see important information
* Modules in this layout do not line up in columns and some text, like title, overlap columns

#### CSS-Tricks
* Low contrast design with similar dark colors for sections
* Article is centered on page
* Gradients for some sections (low contrast, subtle changes)
* Highlighting important information with high contrast bright font colors

#### Microsoft Fluent Design
* Unique scrolling experience, viewport sized panes layered over each other
* Scroll rate of images and text is different
* Elaborate animation on page load, and nice graphics through out page
* Images and scrolling experience is emphasized more than text
* Use of shadows under scrolling panes emphasizes change of subject

#### National Geographic
* Animated infographics end with clear data
* Minimal clear text, large font, centered
* Animated colors end with soft colors
* Very simple small header, with a few main options and dropdown for more links in an intuitive location
