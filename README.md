## Data
Both charts are using Google Charts Library. The data sets are relatively simple and easy to instantiate using Google Charts.

Renewable Energy Production in Florida Data
- I thought this would best be displayed as a Column Chart with Google Charts. Column charts are good at showing change over time. In this case, the increase in BTU per year. The goal of this chart is to show how the data trends over the given time.

Total Electricity Consumption in Florida Data
- I used a Line chart to add variety to the charts being shown, but I think a column chart like the Renewable Energy Production Chart would be best. The Line chart still shows the change over time well, but I think the columns make the amounts per year look more distinct and defined.

I think the best way to display this data would actually be a Column chart with two series, one for each data set, to show a side by side comparison for each year. An alternative would also be a Combo chart of the two charts used.
